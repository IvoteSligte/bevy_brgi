# Shaders
- check whether or not a perspective probe should be spawned or not
- propagate color in perspective texture (too sparse right now)
- add shader define (specialisation key) to allow cameras with just regular pbr code
- standard material integration
- on miss in the deferred_lighting shader, still spawn a probe or do something else? (currently does nothing)

# General
- rename screen_cache and world_cache to something more fitting
- lower resolution screen space rendering?
